    Been to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon before? You‚Äôve undoubtedly come to the Welcome Reception + Booth Crawl or the All-Attendee Party (or both!) and had an amazing time connecting with fellow #TeamCloudNative members and the local culture. Together we‚Äôve been to Tivoli Gardens, piano-dualed, watched an artist spill coffee to create his works, crawled the haunts of Rainey Street, and dipped our toes in a pool by the Valencian palms. As our community has grown, so too have our events, and we're working hard to create new opportunities for everyone to connect, collaborate, and have fun.

    We are thrilled to announce that we'll be providing an enhanced, integrated experience for everyone by combining the Welcome Reception + Booth Crawl and All-Attendee Party into one big celebration on the first official night of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon! Combining these parties means:
    * Fewer long event days

    * A one-stop-shop for mingling with sponsors while also experiencing the flavor of the city

    Don‚Äôt miss out on the latest and greatest party at your favorite tech event! We‚Äôll see you in Amsterdam!
